### After the Workshop

We will share our insights on this website as well as a dissemination blogpost for designers, educational technologists and other interested parties through Medium. Our aim is to encourage participants to collaboratively write research papers about the themes discussed during the workshop. This workshop will be followed by at least one journal article, and an activity that will be dedicated to building new collaborations, both new projects and publications comparing case-studies.
