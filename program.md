## Workshop Program
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has given us an opportunity to run a very different kind of workshop. We have modified the structure and flow of the workshop to suit **asynchronous participation** across multiple time zones, and it will be taking place digitally on **Microsoft Teams (MS Teams)**. Participants will be invited to a collaboration space by the organizers (Microsoft account is not required to join). Although the workshop is divided over two days, it still requires only 2-3 hours of participation in total.

### Throughout the Workshop: Networking Activities (on MS Teams)
- **Individual introductions:** We (workshop organizers) will post individual video introductions and encourage participants to do the same. Minimally, we will add participants' pictures and short bio (that they included in their submission) to the MS Teams channel; they can add the video intro to this.
- **Virtual coffee break:** A synchronous/asynchronous chat channel will be available to all participants for off-topic conversation and networking.

### Day 1: Workshop Activity - Read and Engage (on MS Teams)
- **‘Challenges’ Presentation:** We will hold an online live presentation (time TBD) on challenges associated with implementation and evaluation of emerging technologies in the classroom, incorporating the challenges identified from the paper submissions. While the participation in the real-time session is encouraged, it will be recorded and posted on MS Teams channel for everyone. Along with this presentation, the organizers will provide a list of challenges, which will be the basis for the participant interaction.
- **Read and Engage:** Participants will be assigned one of the submissions and asked to choose another (or more than one) to review and comment on. While reading the chosen papers, the participants are asked to identify which challenge(s) the submission relates to, and add to the list if there is no match. In addition, they are asked to think of solutions (at least one) for the challenges. Participants are free to comment on other aspects of the submissions and the submission authors are encouraged to interact with others.
- This activity will start with the ‘Challenges’ presentation and stay open for 2-2.5 days in order to allow all participants from various time zones two days of interaction.

### Day 2: Conclusion (on MS Teams)
On the second day (midday BST), we will hold another **online live session** (recorded) to summarize the exchange on MS Team activity channel and post a written summary at the end of the second day to conclude the workshop. As participants may continue to post, the summary is to be updated when all the comments are in.

### After the Workshop
We will share our insights on this website as well as a dissemination blogpost for designers, educational technologists and other interested parties through Medium. Our aim is to encourage participants to collaboratively write research papers about the themes discussed during the workshop. This workshop will be followed by at least one journal article, and an activity that will be dedicated to building new collaborations, both new projects and publications comparing case-studies.
