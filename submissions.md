## Call for Submissions
This is a virtual workshop organised as part of the [IDC 2020](https://idc.acm.org/2020/) conference on 18-19 June, 2020. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in educational technology innovations and implementations in the HCI domain and stimulate a discussion on approaches for the evaluation of novel educational technologies. While we cannot meet physically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that this virtual workshop will offer the same benefits to the participants. You will still be able to network and meet people with similar interests. We hope that it will enable thoughtful engagement considering the new (virtual) format. 

We invite participants to submit a 2-4 page paper following the [SIGCHI Extended Abstract format](https://idc.acm.org/2020/chi-proceedings-format/) on ongoing or planned research/practice projects and the evaluation challenges encountered or expected, and/or a discussion of an evaluation framework or method.

The **topics** include, but not limited to: 

-	Emerging technologies in the classroom
-	Targeting 21st century skills

We ask submitters to include a short bio and picture of each author, for inclusion on the workshop website.

Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers based on relevance to the workshop and the potential for contributing to discussions. Accepted submissions will become the basis of workshop discussion. See [Program](https://sabaci.github.io/EdTechEvalWS/program.html) page for details.

At least one author of each accepted submission must participate in the workshop.

Participation without submission is accepted, but paper submissions will be given priority due to max participation size (16). **Please submit your paper to [EdTechEvaluationWS@gmail.com](mailto:edtechevaluationws@gmail.com) by 10th May 2020.**

### Workshop format
As the physical conference is cancelled by the IDC2020 Organizing Committee, we converted our workshop to virtual format and still encourage those interested in this workshop to submit to participate. Our hope is that no matter what the context, we are able to bring the community together to support each other and advance our practice. We redesigned this workshop as a virtual one to ensure that participants still gain the benefits of meeting and working closely with researchers and practitioners working in related areas. This will also allow your work to get more exposure, and hopefully get everyone to experience and contribute to the design of effective online workshops for future events. The workshop will take place through mostly asynchronous activities over two days, but it should still take a similar time commitment (3 hours) from the participants. More details can be found on the [Program](https://sabaci.github.io/EdTechEvalWS/program.html) page.
