## Call for Submissions

This is a half-day workshop organised as part of the [IDC 2020](https://idc.acm.org/2020/) conference held in London, UK. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in educational technology innovations and implementations in the HCI domain and stimulate a discussion on approaches for the evaluation of novel educational technologies. 

We invite participants to submit a 2-4 page paper following the [SIGCHI Extended Abstract format](https://idc.acm.org/2020/chi-proceedings-format/) on ongoing or planned research/practice projects and the evaluation challenges encountered or expected, and/or a discussion of an evaluation framework or method.

The **topics** include, but not limited to: 
•	Emerging technologies in the classroom
•	Targeting 21st century skills

Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers based on relevance to the workshop and the potential for contributing to discussions. Accepted submissions will become the basis of workshop discussions. 

At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and the main conference.

Please submit your paper to [EdTechEvaluationWS@gmail.com](mailto:edtechevaluationws@gmail.com) by 13 April 2020.
